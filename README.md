- 👋 Hi, I’m @colingasper
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end development, HTML email marketing, and blockchain technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript to establish a foundation in web design.  After that, I would like to learn Python and Solidity to expand my knowledge of software development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything to gain experience and inspiration.
- 📫 You can reach me at cgasper100@gmail.com.
